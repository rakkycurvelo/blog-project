					<p><img class="me" src="images/me_.jpg" alt="A picture of me">  My name is Raquelline Curvelo and I start to believe that someday I would be a web developer when I was studing in my high school. I mean, I always like computer, so, why not? </p>

					<p>Years after that, I started to study a bachelors degree in Information Systems and that's where I face boolean numbers and variables for the first time. I gave up and started another bachelous in journalism, but I was always with that in mind...  </p>
